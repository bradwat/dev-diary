Reflect
I Dont know if i could make a simple website with what i've learned so far.
I understand the purpose of git, it's putting it to use that stumps me.
The most interesting thing I've learned so far is, i'm not as tech savy as i once thought.

Review
Git is a version control program that allows multiple users to make additions and changes to softwar
the difference between <ul> and <ol> is that ol will make a list with bullet points, ul will make what is called an unorderd list.
the a tag inserts hyper linnks into a website, that will take the user to a different webpage if clicked.
